# hello-world
It's a small step for me nowadays, but a huge step for my future.
It is my first time that I have used the Github, which is popular among the programmers.
Though I know poor about computer programming now, I'd like to try using this and begin to learn sth about various kinds of languages.
If you are happened to see this page, I feel glad that we can meet in this way through the Internet.
Thanks!
